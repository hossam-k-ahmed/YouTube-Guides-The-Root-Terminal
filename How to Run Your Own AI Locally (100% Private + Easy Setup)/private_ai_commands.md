## 🪟 For Windows Users

We recommend installing the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.  
WSL lets you run a full Linux environment directly on Windows — perfect for AI projects.  

**Open the Command Prompt (cmd) as an Administrator and run:**



    wsl --install


This will:  

- Enable WSL on your Windows system  
- Install the latest WSL 2 version  
- Download the default Ubuntu Linux distribution  

Once installation completes, **restart your computer**.  
After reboot, you can launch **Ubuntu** from the Start Menu and continue with the commands below.

## For Linux Users

You can skip the WSL installation and proceed directly.  
The commands in this file are ready to set up your **private AI environment** on any modern Linux distribution.

## 🎯 Next Steps

- Install necessary dependencies  
- Set up your local AI environment  
- Prepare your system to run AI models privately  

Let’s get your **private AI running locally**!
